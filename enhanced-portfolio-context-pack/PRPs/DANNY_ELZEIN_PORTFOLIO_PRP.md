## Motion & Interaction Guidelines
- Persist user preferences (theme/motion) across sessions
- **Reduced motion**: disable Vanta, parallax, counters, and hover videos
- **Do**: Lead with metrics; keep motion calm; one WebGL canvas; show live availability
- **Don't**: Over-animate; add multiple canvases; bury metrics; break tab/keyboard flow
